In order to run our machine learning model, first run "Team+Delta+Data+Science+Project+Part+1+Data+Merging.ipynb"
to generate the merged date file, then run "Team+Delta+Data+Science+Project+Part+2+Running+Models.ipynb"
in order to obtain the output.

Make sure everything is in the same directory as "Project Files," which include the raw datasets.

Also, if you are interested in our highly inefficient custom pivot table function, among other things, 
you can find it in the "Depreciated" folder.
